    <h3>Abstract:</h3>
    <p>Semantic segmentation models are predominantly based on supervised or unsupervised learning methodologies,
      which require substantial effort in annotation or training.
      In this study, we present a novel framework that leverages multiple pre-trained foundational models for
      semantic segmentation tasks on previously unseen images, eliminating
      the need for additional training. Our framework utilizes image recognition models to
      transform an input image into textual information. This text information is then used to
      engage an advanced Large Language Model (LLM) to predict the presence of specific
      classes within the given image. The labels predicted by the LLM are subsequently processed through
      an open-set detection and segmentation model to generate our ultimate
      outcomes. To ensure that the class information is precisely aligned with the intended
      context, we incorporate both a pre-refinement and a post-refinement procedure utilizing
      the LLM. The segmentation model is further modified to accept both bounding boxes and
      point prompts, resulting in higher accuracy than original usage that only accepts bounding boxes as input.
      Our proposed framework accomplishes training-free zero-shot semantic segmentation, requiring only the input image
      and customizable target classes for different scenarios as inputs. Experiments indicate that the proposed framework demonstrates
      the capacity to execute semantic segmentation effectively across various datasets.
      Notably, our results surpass those of existing unsupervised models despite the absence
      of any training procedure.

    <h3>Proposed Framework:</h3>
    <p>Our framework consists of three sub-components: a) Image recognition models,
      which include a Recognize Anything Plus Model (RAM++) [14] and a BLIP-2 [19] model. These
      models process input images to generate a list of tags and a caption that reflects the textual
      information present in the input image. b) An advanced GPT-4 [23] model is employed for
      a pre-refinement process, which process the textual information into predicted classes for
      the segmentation model. The system automatically generates prompts based on predefined
      target classes specific to different datasets. c) a pre-trained open-set segmentation model
      Grounded-SAM [28] that is able to detect and segment certain classes in the images based
      on predicted classes. A post-refinement process is applied during the detection phase using
      the same GPT-4 model.
